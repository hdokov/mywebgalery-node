Lightweight (probably) CMS based on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/), 
[Ractive](http://ractivejs.org/) &amp; [Vital](http://doximity.github.io/vital/)

## Description
This is my new sunday project to create a CMS that is easy to use by non-devs, is pretty basic and lightweight (hopefully)
and can be deployed as easy as possible.

My final aim is not to compete with Wordpress (or even Joomla or Drupal :smiley:) but to have some fun 
and learn a few new technologies.

If there are some things that look a bit rubyist or relsish that's not a co-incedence :smiley:
